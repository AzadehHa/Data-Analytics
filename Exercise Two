#Explanation: From this full dataset and three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, we drew a random sample of 30 data points.
# This sample provided a snapshot of the dataset—just a small subset of observations. By printing the sample, 
# we confirmed the variability in the data, showing that each randomly selected data point could belong to 
# any species and have a wide range of sepal lengths and widths.
# After that, we decided to investigate the variability of the mean sepal length across multiple samples. We repeated 
# the sampling process 100 times, each time drawing a random sample of 30 data points and calculating the mean sepal length for 
# that sample. This gave us a sampling distribution of the mean. The results were striking: the means of the 100 samples clustered 
# around a central value, reflecting the true mean of the population. This is a perfect example of the Central Limit Theorem in
# action—no matter how the data is distributed, the distribution of sample means will tend to be normal (or bell-shaped) as 
# we take more and more samples.
# This histogram of  100 sample means visually reinforces this idea. It shows a normal distribution, indicating that most of 
# the sample means are close to the  population mean. The dispersion (or variance) of the sample means is also apparent, 
# demonstrating the natural variability that comes with random sampling.
# Additionally, a systematic sample was viewed alongside the original data set to compare the appearance of the two data sets 
# in terms of the relationship between sepal length and  sepal width. The scatter plot shows that while the original data set 
# appears more random, the systematic sample has a more regular structure, reflecting the uniform nature of the sampling method.
